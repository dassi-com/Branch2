                <h1> Being a good leader isn’t just being a boss.</h1>
                <p>
                    It’s not about time sheets, or quarterly reports, or calling shots. A good leader gets results—and that starts by empowering and inspiring the people around you. 
                    This FREE, one-day virtual class can help you unlearn old and broken methods of managing people and help you identify ways you can adjust your leadership style to start getting results.

            <p>The class itself is 4 hours, broken into four 45-minute sessions with 15 minute breaks.

            <h2>Am I guaranteed a promotion? </h2>
            <p>While we'd love to be able to guarantee a promotion, we aren't fortune tellers. What we can guarantee is that you'll be given the tools, techniques, and support you need to clarify what you want, articulate your worth, and lead a team strategically.  </p>

        <div class="section3-4">
            <h2> Do you offer 1:1 Coaching?</h2>
            <p>YES! I recommend first taking my free virtual group class—most attendees get a lot of value from it. From there we can identify your short or long-term goals and work towards achieving them together. </p>
